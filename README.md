## Learning Track
### 1. [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/):
* [Python for Everybody](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/) 
  (course)
  
  Video course teaches the basics of programming using Python 3. \
  Created by Dr. Charles Severance (a.k.a. Dr. Chuck). \
  Official course page [py4e.com](https://www.py4e.com/).

  
* [Arithmetic Formatter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter)
  (project)
  
  Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.


* [Time Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/time-calculator)
  (project)

  Write a function named "add_time" that can add a duration to a start time and return the result.


* [Budget App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app)
  (project)

  Create a "Category" class that can be used to create different budget categories.


* [Polygon Area Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/polygon-area-calculator)
  (project)

  Use object-oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.
